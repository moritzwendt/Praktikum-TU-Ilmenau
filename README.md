# Praktikum-TU-Ilmenau
## Website Overview

I developed this website as part of my internship at **Technische Universität Ilmenau**. Its purpose is to showcase my experiences in **IT Systems Integration**. The site was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### Key Features:
- **Overview of Internship Tasks**: A comprehensive look at the tasks and projects I worked on.
- **Contact Option**: Easy access to get in touch with me.
- **Useful Links**: Direct connections to the university’s resources and important pages.

I prioritized a **clean, minimal design** to ensure content is easily digestible and engaging. Features like a **modal for contact info** and a **dynamic task display** enhance user interaction, making it more than just a static webpage. 

## Purpose:
The website is focused on **educational documentation** and presents all the important information in a **structured and user-friendly manner**. It is not intended for commercial use.
